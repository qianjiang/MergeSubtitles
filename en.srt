1
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,396
It's six o'clock in the morning,

2
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,740
pitch black outside.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,676
My 14-year-old son
is fast asleep in his bed,

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,780
sleeping the reckless,
deep sleep of a teenager.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,796
I flip on the light and physically
shake the poor boy awake,

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,436
because I know that,
like ripping off a Band-Aid,

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,396
it's better to get it over with quickly.

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,076
(Laughter)

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,836
I have a friend who yells "Fire!"
just to rouse her sleeping teen.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,836
And another who got so fed up

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,716
that she had to dump cold water
on her son's head

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,660
just to get him out of bed.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,156
Sound brutal ...

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,980
but perhaps familiar?

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,276
Every morning I ask myself,

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,876
"How can I --

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,636
knowing what I know

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,076
and doing what I do for a living --

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,100
be doing this to my own son?"

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,156
You see,

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,876
I'm a sleep researcher.

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,076
(Laughter)

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,916
So I know far too much about sleep

24
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,636
and the consequences of sleep loss.

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,756
I know that I'm depriving my son
of the sleep he desperately needs

26
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:18,660
as a rapidly growing teenager.

27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,436
I also know that by waking him up

28
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,116
hours before his natural
biological clock tells him he's ready,

29
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,540
I'm literally robbing him
of his dreams --

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,996
the type of sleep most associated
with learning, memory consolidation

31
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,860
and emotional processing.

32
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,460
But it's not just my kid
that's being deprived of sleep.

33
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,340
Sleep deprivation among
American teenagers is an epidemic.

34
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,676
Only about one in 10 gets
the eight to 10 hours of sleep per night

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,900
recommended by sleep scientists
and pediatricians.

36
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,836
Now, if you're thinking to yourself,

37
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,116
"Phew, we're doing good,
my kid's getting eight hours,"

38
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,356
remember,

39
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,876
eight hours is
the minimum recommendation.

40
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,956
You're barely passing.

41
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,820
Eight hours is kind of like
getting a C on your report card.

42
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,620
There are many factors
contributing to this epidemic,

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,956
but a major factor preventing teens
from getting the sleep they need

44
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,299
is actually a matter of public policy.

45
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,860
Not hormones, social lives or Snapchat.

46
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,596
Across the country,

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,476
many schools are starting
around 7:30am or earlier,

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,596
despite the fact that major
medical organizations recommend

49
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,060
that middle and high school
start no earlier than 8:30am.

50
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,196
These early start policies
have a direct effect on how much --

51
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,220
or really how little sleep
American teenagers are getting.

52
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,236
They're also pitting
teenagers and their parents

53
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,340
in a fundamentally unwinnable fight
against their own bodies.

54
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,996
Around the time of puberty,

55
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,756
teenagers experience a delay
in their biological clock,

56
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,460
which determines when we feel most awake
and when we feel most sleepy.

57
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,980
This is driven in part by a shift
in the release of the hormone melatonin.

58
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,436
Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasing
melatonin until around 11pm,

59
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,780
which is two hours later than what
we see in adults or younger children.

60
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,676
This means that waking a teenager up
at 6am is the biological equivalent

61
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,660
of waking an adult up at 4am.

62
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,556
On the unfortunate days
when I have to wake up at 4am,

63
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,916
I'm a zombie.

64
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,676
Functionally useless.

65
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,316
I can't think straight,

66
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,836
I'm irritable,

67
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,300
and I probably shouldn't be driving a car.

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,620
But this is how many American
teenagers feel every single school day.

69
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,116
In fact, many of the, shall we say,

70
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,476
unpleasant characteristics
that we chalk up to being a teenager --

71
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,916
moodiness, irritability,
laziness, depression --

72
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,820
could be a product
of chronic sleep deprivation.

73
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,636
For many teens
battling chronic sleep loss,

74
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,156
their go-to strategy to compensate
is consuming large quantities of caffeine

75
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,356
in the form of venti frappuccinos,

76
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,220
or energy drinks and shots.

77
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,116
So essentially,

78
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,140
we've got an entire population
of tired but wired youth.

79
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,036
Advocates of sleep-friendly
start times know

80
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,596
that adolescence is a period
of dramatic brain development,

81
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,676
particularly in the parts of the brain

82
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,236
that are responsible for those
higher order thinking processes,

83
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,540
including reasoning, problem-solving
and good judgment.

84
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,276
In other words, the very type
of brain activity that's responsible

85
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,876
for reining in those impulsive
and often risky behaviors

86
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,836
that are so characteristic of adolescence

87
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,620
and that are so terrifying
to us parents of teenagers.

88
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,316
They know that like the rest of us,

89
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,756
when teenagers don't
get the sleep they need,

90
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,916
their brains, their bodies
and behaviors suffer

91
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,580
with both immediate and lasting effects.

92
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,916
They can't concentrate,

93
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,836
their attention plummets

94
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,620
and many will even show
behavioral signs that mimic ADHD.

95
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,556
But the consequences of teen sleep loss
go well beyond the classroom,

96
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,196
sadly contributing to many
of the mental health problems

97
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,916
that skyrocket during adolescence,

98
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,756
including substance use,

99
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,260
depression and suicide.

100
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,396
In our work with teens
from LA Unified School District,

101
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,636
we found that teens with sleep problems

102
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,860
were 55 percent more likely
to have used alcohol in the past month.

103
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,796
In another study with over
30,000 high school students,

104
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,396
they found that
for each hour of lost sleep,

105
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,140
there was a 38 percent increase
in feeling sad or hopeless,

106
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,100
and a 58 percent increase
in teen suicide attempts.

107
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,676
And if that's not enough,

108
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,236
teens who skip out on sleep
are at increased risk

109
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,316
for a host of physical health problems
that plague our country,

110
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,420
including obesity,
heart disease and diabetes.

111
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,476
Then there's the risk
of putting a sleep-deprived teen,

112
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,036
with a newly minted driver's license,

113
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,340
behind the wheel.

114
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,476
Studies have shown that getting five hours
or less of sleep per night

115
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:42,180
is the equivalent of driving with a blood
alcohol content above the legal limit.

116
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,516
Advocates of sleep-friendly start times,

117
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,596
and researchers in this area,

118
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,796
have produced tremendous science

119
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,716
showing the tremendous benefits
of later start times.

120
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,036
The findings are unequivocal,

121
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,756
and as a sleep scientist,

122
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,500
I rarely get to speak
with that kind of certainty.

123
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,796
Teens from districts
with later start times get more sleep.

124
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,316
To the naysayers who may think
that if schools start later,

125
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,980
teens will just stay up later,

126
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,996
the truth is,

127
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,956
their bedtimes stay the same,

128
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,236
but their wake-up times get extended,

129
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,420
resulting in more sleep.

130
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,556
They're more likely to show up for school;

131
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,476
school absences dropped
by 25 percent in one district.

132
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,076
And they're less likely to drop out.

133
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,596
Not surprisingly,
they do better academically.

134
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,356
So this has real implications
for reducing the achievement gap.

135
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,076
Standardized test scores
in math and reading

136
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,540
go up by two to three percentage points.

137
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,716
That's as powerful as reducing class sizes
by one-third fewer students,

138
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,916
or replacing a so-so teacher
in the classroom

139
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,100
with a truly outstanding one.

140
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,796
Their mental and physical health improves,

141
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,156
and even their families are happier.

142
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,996
I mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little
more pleasantness from our teens,

143
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,980
and a little less crankiness?

144
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,716
Even their communities are safer

145
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,276
because car crash rates go down --

146
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,140
a 70 percent reduction in one district.

147
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,636
Given these tremendous benefits,

148
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,996
you might think,

149
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,716
well, this is a no-brainer, right?

150
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,020
So why have we as a society
failed to heed this call?

151
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,060
Often the argument against later
start times goes something like this:

152
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,116
"Why should we delay
start times for teenagers?

153
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,380
We need to toughen them up
so they're ready for the real world!"

154
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,916
But that's like saying
to the parent of a two-year-old,

155
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,436
"Don't let Johnny nap,

156
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,876
or he won't be ready for kindergarten."

157
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,100
(Laughter)

158
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,596
Delaying start times also presents
many logistical challenges.

159
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,996
Not just for students and their families,

160
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,396
but for communities as a whole.

161
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,996
Updating bus routes,

162
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,076
increased transportation costs,

163
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,636
impact on sports,

164
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,076
care before or after school.

165
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,676
These are the same concerns
that come up in district after district,

166
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,676
time and again around the country

167
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,780
as school start times are debated.

168
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,460
And they're legitimate concerns,

169
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,340
but these are problems
we have to work through.

170
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,196
They are not valid excuses

171
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,980
for failing to do the right thing
for our children,

172
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,620
which is to start middle and high schools
no earlier than 8:30am.

173
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,476
And in districts around the country,

174
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,116
big and small,
who have made this change,

175
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,916
they found that these fears
are often unfounded

176
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,356
and far outweighed by the tremendous
benefits for student health

177
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,036
and performance,

178
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,020
and our collective public safety.

179
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,756
So tomorrow morning,

180
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,500
when coincidentally we get
to set our clocks back by an hour

181
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,900
and you get that delicious
extra hour of sleep,

182
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,060
and the day seems a little longer,

183
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,540
and a little more full of hope,

184
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,500
think about the tremendous power of sleep.

185
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,916
And think about what a gift it would be

186
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,956
for our children to be able
to wake up naturally,

187
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,220
in harmony with their own biology.

188
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,476
Thank you,

189
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,700
and pleasant dreams.
